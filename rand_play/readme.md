# rand_play
Random background music player

music is added to the sounds folder with naming convention of sound.1.ogg sound.2.ogg sound.3.ogg etc.
Of course you can use any name you wish just be sure to set that option config.lua file.
if you want to change the sounds from time to time just add different prefixed names in the sounds folder then change the prefix setting in config.lua.
It will only randomly select those files named accordingly. See sample files for example naming.

options in config.lua are commented to explain the use.
Definitely set them up first before using.
